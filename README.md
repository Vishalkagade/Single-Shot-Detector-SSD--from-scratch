This SSD300 model is based on the SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector paper, which describes SSD as “a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network”. The input size is fixed to 300x300.

The main difference between this model and the one described in the paper is in the backbone. Specifically, the VGG model.
